/**
 * Disposable local server for automated browser E2E tests.
 *
 * This wrapper owns only the `.tmp/e2e-*` data used by Playwright. It resets
 * that data, then runs the same Vite + Bun CMS stack a developer uses — with one
 * deliberate difference: the CMS runs WITHOUT `--watch`.
 *
 * Why no watch: under `bun --watch`, the publish pipeline writing baked HTML into
 * the uploads dir (and the SQLite DB churning) can trigger a server reload mid
 * test, which drops in-memory state and tears the stack down. A regression suite
 * needs a stable server, so E2E pins one. Vite is additionally told to ignore the
 * runtime-written paths (see `vite.config.ts`), so publishing never reloads the
 * admin app mid-test either.
